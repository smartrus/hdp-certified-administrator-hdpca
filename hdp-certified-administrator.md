Hortonworks has redesigned its certification program to create an industry-recognized certification where
individuals prove their Hadoop knowledge by performing actual hands-on tasks on a Hortonworks Data
Platform (HDP) cluster, as opposed to answering multiple-choice questions. The HDP Certified Administrator
(HDPCA) exam is designed for Hadoop system administrators and operators responsible for installing,
configuring and supporting an HPD cluster. The cost of the exam is $250 USD per attempt.

## Purpose of the exam

The purpose of this exam is to provide organizations that use Hadoop with a means of identifying suitably
qualified staff to install, configure, secure and troubleshoot a Hortonworks Data Platform cluster using Apache
Ambari.

## Exam description

The exam has five main categories of tasks that involve:

* Installation
* Configuration
* Troubleshooting
* High Availability
* Security

The exam is based on the Hortonworks Data Platform 2.3 installed and managed with Ambari 2.1.
